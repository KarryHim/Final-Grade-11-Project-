# Final-Grade-11-Project-
A Game Created for my Grade 11 Computer Science Class. 

For the final summative, I created a very simple game using Python. To win, all you have to do is pump the robots with happiness before they go to work. If the factory's depression load is too great, it shuts down and you lose the game.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that GitHub does not allow files greater than 25mb to be imported, I was not able to import all of the game's soundtrack.
